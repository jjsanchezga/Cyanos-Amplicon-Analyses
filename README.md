# Cyanos-Amplicon-Analyses
This script was written in RStudio for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in support of the manuscript titled “Shedding New Light on Picocyanobacteria and Understudied Cyanobacterial Diversity in the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound System, North Carolina, USA.” The primary aim of this study was to investigate cyanobacterial diversity, composition, and biogeography, as well as the environmental factors influencing their distribution across three regions of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES): Albemarle Sound, Pamlico Sound, and the Neuse River Estuary.
To achieve this, I conducted amplicon sequencing analysis of cyanobacteria across the three APES regions to resolve their diversity, biogeography, and environmental drivers within this interconnected estuary. All fieldwork was conducted between 2017 and 2019 as part of the Neuse River Estuary Modeling and Monitoring Project (ModMon) and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) Ambient Monitoring Program. Laboratory work was performed at the NCSU-Paerl Lab by J. Sanchez-Gallego and collaborators (Principal Investigator: Ryan Paerl). All code was written by J. Sanchez-Gallego in 2023 and 2025.
